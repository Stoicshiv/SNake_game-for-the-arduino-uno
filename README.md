# SNake_game-for-the-arduino-uno
The dynamic game requires the grid to be constantly updated, creating the illusion of motion. In this version, the grid will be refreshed every cycle, and the snake will move on its own based on direction input. Players can still change the direction of the snake dynamically using the w, a, s, and d keys.
